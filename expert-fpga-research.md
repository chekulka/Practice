# Expert FPGA Research: Xilinx FPGA, AVED, and Versal 80

## Question

Do any of the listed experts have experience with Xilinx FPGA, AVED (Alveo Versal Example Design), or Versal 80 (AMD/Xilinx Versal adaptive SoC)?

## Answer: None of the 15 listed experts have documented work with these technologies

All 15 experts' domains span AI/ML software, MLOps, product management, economics, data science, power engineering, and fintech — distinct from FPGA/reconfigurable computing.

### Individual Assessments

| Expert | FPGA/AVED/Versal Work? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Jorge Ortiz | NA | ECE professor at Rutgers, but focuses on ML for cyber-physical systems (software side), not FPGA design |
| Michael Seltenreich | NA | AI/ML at Anthropic; no hardware work |
| AJ Green | NA | AI community building; no hardware work |
| Demetrios Brinkmann | NA | MLOps community; software operations only |
| Adrian Johnson | NA | Product management / document automation; no hardware work |
| Boaz Descalo | NA | BSc EE (Technion), worked at Intel/Lantiq/Sigma Designs in algorithms & system engineering — closest background but no FPGA-specific work documented |
| Yujian Tang | NA | AI/ML, NLP, vector databases; no hardware work |
| Vincent Koc | NA | AI research, LLM evaluation; no hardware work |
| Bruno Guardia | NA | Software architecture; no hardware work |
| Supriya Gupta | NA | Product management, fintech; no hardware work |
| Dmitry Shapiro | NA | BS EE (Georgia Tech) but entire career in consumer software products |
| Andrew Bluiett | NA | BSEE, IEEE Senior Member but in power utility substation engineering, not FPGA |
| Arpita Vats | NA | Computer vision / NLP research; software only |
| Pavlo Buryi | NA | Economics professor; no engineering work |
| Moody Billah | NA | Data science / analytics; no hardware work |
