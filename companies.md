### Chime

#### 1. Staff Data Analyst (Strategic Finance) — STRONGEST MATCH
- **Location:** San Francisco, CA (Hybrid)
- **Salary:** $170,000 - $235,000
- **Apply:** [Greenhouse Application](https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/chime/jobs/8403065002)

**Description:** Lead critical forecasting and performance insights for Chime's core growth and revenue drivers. Set the strategy and operating model for forecasting across key metrics (member growth, purchase volume, deposit volume), drive scenario planning and investment tradeoffs with senior leadership, and elevate how Chime measures and communicates performance and unit economics.

**Requirements:** 8-10 years in strategic finance, forecasting/FP&A, finance analytics, or similar. Fintech/payments/consumer financial services strongly preferred. Advanced SQL, Python or R proficiency strongly preferred.

**Fit:** Excellent — directly aligns with forecasting, KPI frameworks, statistical modeling, and analytics architecture expertise. Fintech preference is a direct match. 6+ years is slightly below 8-10 year ask but Lead-level title and breadth of technical skills (dbt, Airflow, Python, R) compensate.

- **Location:** San Francisco, CA (Hybrid)
- **Salary:** $133,300 - $207,300

**Description:** Build and own the organizational process, technical infrastructure, and statistical techniques to forecast Chime's member funnel. Mix of analytics engineering (building data system to generate, store, and analyze forecasts) and analytics insights (understanding the "why" of changes). Scenario planning with leadership, monitoring financial KPIs and unit economics.

**Requirements:** 5+ years in data-focused roles. Proficiency in financial metrics. SQL expertise. Analytics engineering familiarity including dbt. Sound statistical inference skills.

**Fit:** Excellent — practically tailor-made. Explicitly requires dbt, SQL expertise, statistical inference, financial KPI monitoring, and forecasting. The "Lead" level matches current title. Note: May have been reposted — verify availability.

- **Location:** Remote - US
- **Salary:** $140,670 - $195,400

**Requirements:** 5+ years in analytics (Trust & Safety, Fraud, Risk, or Support Operations ideal). Advanced SQL. Proficiency in Python or R. Strong understanding of statistics, causal inference, experiment design, and anomaly detection.

**Fit:** Strong — the only fully US Remote role. Directly requires A/B testing, causal inference, KPI frameworks, Python/R, and SQL. Domain focus on Trust & Safety/Disputes rather than general product analytics, but fintech background and statistical modeling expertise translate well.

- **Location:** San Francisco, CA (Hybrid — 4 days in office)
- **Salary:** $140,670 - $195,400

**Description:** Develop, test, launch, and scale member banking experience products that build security awareness and adoption. B2C product analytics with a focus on Trust & Safety.

**Requirements:** 5-7 years in data-focused roles, building analytical infrastructure and data tools. B2C product analytics and FinTech experience preferred.

**Fit:** Moderate-Strong — 5-7 year range fits perfectly. Fintech preference aligns. Analytical infrastructure requirement matches analytics architecture and dbt/Airflow experience. Trust & Safety is a narrower focus area but core skills transfer.

#### 6. Data Analyst, Product
- **Location:** San Francisco, CA (Hybrid)
- **Salary:** $124,600 - $155,800
- **Apply:** [Chime Careers](https://careers.chime.com/en/jobs/8038592002/data-analyst-product/)

**Description:** Develop, test, launch, and scale member banking experience products through experimentation, behavioral analysis, statistical and data science modeling, and dashboard development.

**Requirements:** 4+ years in data-focused roles. B2C product analytics and FinTech experience preferred. SQL expertise, R or Python familiarity.

**Fit:** Moderate — skills align well (A/B testing, statistical modeling, Python/R, SQL), but this role is likely **below level**. At 4+ years and a non-senior title, it would be a step down from Lead Data Analyst. Only worth considering if specifically interested in product analytics at a lower salary.
